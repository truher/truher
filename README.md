FRC stuff I've been up to lately:

* [FRC Test](https://github.com/truher/frc-test): a collection of FIRST robotics stuff I'm playing with
* [FRC Vision](https://github.com/truher/frc-vision-old): Stuff related to  the older retroreflective vision system:
  * Global pose estimation and simulation, using OpenCV and stereo cameras.
  * Detailed safety and sensitivity analysis of a bright monochromatic illuminator.
  * Electrical design for the illuminator.
* [Optic Sim](https://github.com/truher/optic-sim): photon simulation of the vision illuminator/reflector/detector mentioned above, using CuPy to run millions of photons in reasonable time.
* [FRC Tone](https://github.com/truher/frc-tone): a Java app for the Driver Station that produces AIM-9 targeting audible tones, intended for semi-autonomous driver feedback.
* [FRC Logs](https://github.com/truher/frc-logs): a place to put RoboRIO logs recorded to USB by DataLogManager.
* [FRC Analysis](https://github.com/truher/frc-analysis): an example of log analysis using Python.
* [FRC Console](https://github.com/truher/console): a modular operator console design based on Arduino, with some examples of joysticks, buttons, absolute and incremental rotary encoders, and audio output.
* [FRC CAN Dissector](https://github.com/truher/frc-can-dissector): a Lua plugin for Wireshark that decodes FRC CAN bus messages (e.g. motor controller commands, heartbeats, etc)
* [FRC CAN Logger](https://github.com/truher/can-logger): a Teensy (Arduino) app that listens to CAN bus messages through a Waveshare tranceiver and writes them to SD.  Also a little bracket to hold the Teensy and transceiver.
* [Swerve Sim](https://github.com/truher/swerve-sim): a simple simulation of swerve drive, using "perfect" forward kinematics.  This would be useful for navigational simulation.
* [Radar](https://github.com/truher/radar): a driver station dashboard that shows robot-centric and field-centric views of a few kinds of target poses read from Network Tables.  It's an example of an NT4 app.
* [Swervo](https://github.com/truher/swervo): low cost swerve drive trainer, using servos for driving and steering.

Other projects:

* [Power logger](https://github.com/truher/power-logger): hardware and software for residential electric power measurement, using a Teensy and many CT coils.
* [Rocket Instrument](https://github.com/truher/RocketInstrument): hardware and software for a logging accelerometer and pressure sensor for high-power model rocketry, based on the Sparkfun Artemis platform.
* [Water](https://github.com/truher/water): hardware and software for domestic water consumption measurement, using a magnetic sensor and a conventional nutating meter.

Folk I work with:

* [FRC Team 100](https://github.com/team100): Woodside High School Robotics
* [FRC Team 8048](https://github.com/churrobots): East Palo Alto Robotics
