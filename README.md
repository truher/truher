Things I've been up to lately:

* [FRC Test](https://github.com/truher/frc-test): a collection of FIRST robotics stuff I'm playing with
* [FRC Vision](https://github.com/truher/frc-vision-old): Stuff related to  the older retroreflective vision system:
  * Global pose estimation and simulation, using OpenCV and stereo cameras.
  * Detailed safety and sensitivity analysis of a bright monochromatic illuminator.
  * Electrical design for the illuminator.
* [FRC Tone](https://github.com/truher/frc-tone): a Java app for the Driver Station that produces AIM-9 targeting audible tones, intended for semi-autonomous driver feedback.
* [FRC Logs](https://github.com/truher/frc-logs): a place to put RoboRIO logs recorded to USB by DataLogManager.
* [FRC Analysis](https://github.com/truher/frc-analysis): an example of log analysis using Python.
* [FRC Console](https://github.com/truher/console): a modular operator console design based on Arduino, with some examples of joysticks, buttons, absolute and incremental rotary encoders, and audio output.
